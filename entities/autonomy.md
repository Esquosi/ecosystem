Autonomy is a tool that allows people to make requests for future actions with arbitrary conditions (e.g. when price of X token goes below Y, buy).
It’s a decentralized network of executors (bots) who are incentivized to execute users’ requests when the condition is met.
Autonomy is infrastructure, similar to ChainLink.
