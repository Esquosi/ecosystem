Rawbots combines blockchain technology with cutting edge game technology to create an experience which is truly unique and driven by its community.

Like Lego Mindstorms, simple building blocks allow the player to create all kinds of robots. Motors, sensors, tools and structural body parts seamlessly connect with one another. Each and every robot part hides a world of options ready to be discovered. Building blocks are designed to be combined in ways even the developers have not considered.

Each robot part can be programmed using our unique visual programming language. This system is designed to be simple to use but powerful to those who take the time to master its complexity.
