Onomy brings unprecedented integration between traditional currencies and decentralized finance. An application-specific blockchain powering an orderbook + AMM decentralized exchange that enables users to trade cryptocurrencies cross-chain. Through ecosystem support of stablecoins representing various national currencies, Onomy intends to converge the $6.6T per day Forex market with the decentralized finance cryptocurrency market.

Onomy is multi-chain at its core, built as part of the Cosmos Ecosystem. Onomy will leverage the inter-blockchain communication protocol to connect with other Cosmos chains, and additionally implements bridges between blockchains like Ethereum, Avalanche, NEAR, and more EVM + non-EVM chains TBA. This enables access accross chains.

Onomy has an extreme focus on user experienece through all of its carefully crafted ecosystem products, of which has been contributed to by a global community. Users can easily manage assets from all chains, including NFT collections, via Onomy Access - a multi-chain mobile app wallet enabling Single Sign On via QR code when using dApps. No more need for convulted browser extensions or managing various wallets. Efficiently trade digital assets on the decentralized Onomy Exchange (ONEX) supporting both AMM and orderbook trading (limit orders, stop loss, market), and mint decentralized stablecoins through the Onomy Reserve (ORES) using NOM, the protocol token, as collateral.
