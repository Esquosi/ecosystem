The Open Forest Protocol (OFP) is changing how forestation (reforestation, afforestation and conservation) projects are monitored, verified and funded with easy-to-use and transparent blockchain tools. Through its MRV platform, OFP will be able to accelerate efforts to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, and bring forth a fully on-chain carbon economy.
