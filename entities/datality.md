There is no platform connecting the world’s private researchers to the world’s research data consumers and providing a safe and secure transaction of data for value.

Datality solves the multilateral data marketplace challenges of trust, provenance, fraud risk, appropriability and market thickness by employing blockchain, escrow systems, covenants, reputation management and local network effects.

The general literature on data markets supports Datality’s potential to grow this market, considering the workflows and safeguards we've built into the platform.

We believe the transparency of the NEAR blockchain is perfect for a publicly-available layer of activity that protects participants against fraud, builds reputations, cultivates marketplace quality in both product and participants, serves as a data source for any independent legal pursuits against fraudsters, serves as a source for unrefuted provenance of data ownership/usage, and sets us up for a DeFi marketplace for research data and beyond.
