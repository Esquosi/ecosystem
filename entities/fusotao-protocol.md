"Fusotao Protocol is a verification protocol for order-book based matching systems, using the paradigm of "execute off-chain, verify on-chain". Assemble values of Web3 by creating a new paradigm of DeFi, founders can build their own DEXs based on Fusotao, and communities can earn rewards by trading on the DEXs or directly share transaction fees through staking tokens for the DEXs backed by Fusotao Protocol. The FXDX to be launched backed by Fusotao Protocol will be the first order-book based DEX in NEAR ecosystem."
