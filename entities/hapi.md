HAPI is a cybersecurity layer that is aimed at preventing and notifying entities within the HAPI Protocol network about potential threats of Money Laundering (ML), hacking, and other unauthorized transactions of funds. The irrefutable advantage of HAPI is the on-chain approach. All of the currently available solutions that work in a similar fashion are centralized and extensively governed single-point entities that operate off-chain. HAPI directly embeds smart contracts which essentially allows the most immediate notification and alerting system that is able to both prevent an adversarial attack, money laundering, and/or alleviate potential losses.
