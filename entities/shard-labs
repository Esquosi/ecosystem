Marnotaur is an AMM-based, cross-chain liquidity protocol for secure decentralized margin trading. Powered by its own margin pools and large external DEXs like Uniswap, the protocol allows users to multiply their gains as well as drastically increase trading efficiency and asset diversification in the DeFi market.
 
Marnotaur can offer exclusive features such as distribution of liquidation fees to stakeholders, permissionless pools and under-collateralized access to stablecoins. The protocol is compatible with all other DeFi protocols, networks and multiple blockchains.
