Solace is a decentralized coverage protocol, insurance-alternative, that allows DeFi liquidity providers and market makers to hedge their risk in the event of smart contract exploits.

Solace advances risk management of decentralized financial products by efficiently making coverage policies available to liquidity providers and other protocols.
