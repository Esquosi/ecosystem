SmartPad is the first launchpad platform of its kind. Our vision is to create a multi-cross-chain launchpad, enabling participation in the IDOs launching on one blockchain while utilizing the assets from another chain.

SmartPad offers a wide array of different launch possibilities to the prospective projects, already supporting Aurora, Polygon, and Ethereum chains. Weâ€™ve recently received a grant from NEAR Foundation to integrate with NEAR Protocol.
