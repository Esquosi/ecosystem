Wrestling Metaverse is a video game that brings together the creativity and excitement of professional wrestling with the scalability and decentralisation of the Blockchain. Players can either create their own wrestler, use the likeness of a real professional wrestler(officially endorsed), or fight with a WM Original. Players can compete against each other online battling for rewards such as: cryptocurrency tokens, opportunities to compete at PPVs, and of course championship belts. Each Wrestler in WM is an NFT that can be bought, played with, or upgraded.
