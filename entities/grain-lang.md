Grain aims to modernize innovative features from functional and academic programming languages and bring them to the masses. Many languages have had wonderful ideas, but they have ultimately been dismissed as esoteric or too difficult to learn and, consequently, have struggled to rally a large community around them. Grain hopes to bring new life to these ideas and present them in an accessible form thatâ€™s easy to use and understand.
