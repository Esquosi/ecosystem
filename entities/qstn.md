"QSTN is an emerging Web3 data platform looking to disrupt the advertising industry by giving individuals power and control over their data.

Launching an application on NEAR Protocol that focuses on consumer data privacy is paramount to the future of web security and internet data regulations as the world transitions to a Web3 structure.

As one of the first such platforms to build and launch (very soon!) on NEAR Protocol, we have found the community to be a vital source of engagement, promotion, and feedback to the QSTN team."
