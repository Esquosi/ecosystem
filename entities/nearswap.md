NEARswap is an AMM protocol. Currently, it implements the Uniswap model. The team created a shared pool structure and researched other models for better AMM experience. With NEARswap and Rainbow bridge you can securely and efficiently exchange NEAR and Ethereum assets. The team used Skynet for their UI and also qualified for a participation prize from our partner Sia!
