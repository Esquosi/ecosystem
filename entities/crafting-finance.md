Crafting Finance is a synthetic asset issuance protocol and decentralized contract trading exchange based on the Polkadot contract chain. It natively supports multi-token collateral, including the token CRF issued by Crafting Finance, Polkadot (DOT), Kusama (KSM), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), and synthesizes any cryptocurrencies or stocks, bonds, gold and any other off-chain assets directly through smart contracts and oracles. Users can forge a certain synthetic asset, such as the US dollar, by collateralizing supported tokens, and automatically have a long position in the asset. Users can also convert minted assets into other assets through the trading platform, so as to realize the purpose of shorting the asset and longing other assets. The assets minted by all the users correspond to the liabilities of the entire system, and the proportion of each user's liabilities has been determined at the time of forging, so that their respective profits can be calculated. Because such a collateral pool model does not require a counterparty, it perfectly solves the problems of liquidity and trading depth in decentralized exchange (DEX).
