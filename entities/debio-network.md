DeBio Network is a decentralized anonymous-first medical and biomedical platform created for users who want to anonymously submit to tests and various medical samples from the comfort of their homes. DeBio Network is created using Substrate, a blockchain framework behind the Polkadot & Kusama Ecosystem. DeBio Network's blockchain will be an Appchain on the Octopus Network, a Substrate relay chain on the NEAR Protocol.
