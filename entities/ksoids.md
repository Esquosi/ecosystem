Meet the Ksoids, an impossibly addictive NFT collectible that not only creates a world all its own, but also helps protect our world. 

Each one of these curious creatures was generated by a hand-crafted algorithm and then lovingly selected by creator Danil Krivoruchko to join an elite group of 1,000 Grade-A Ksoids, all available to the discerning investor. The first few drops were sold on the NFT marketplace OpenSea, and available in randomly selected packs of 1, 4, and 10.
