“Dapplets Project is an open Augmented Web Infrastructure for decentralized Apps (dapplets), all powered by crypto technologies.  Our system is open-source and available to developers anywhere in the world.
Our augmentations are decentralized, unstoppable, permissionless and token-incentivized. We use modern crypto technologies, such as: blockchain for resilient dapplet registries, decentralized storage for dapplet code, community incentivization by crypto-economic patterns etc.”
