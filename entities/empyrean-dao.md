Empyrean DAO is a protocol responsible for the issuance and management of a fully backed, algorithmic, yield generating, free-floating stable asset — EMPYR.

Inspired by OlympusDAO’s work and community, we plan to not only be the first ones to offer the same services as Olympus on Aurora — the EVM compatible shard on NEAR — but also the first to develop further upon OHM’s design to accrue more value to the community.
