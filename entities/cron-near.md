Core goal of Cron is to provide a general access, fully autonomous contracts that enable scheduled function calls for blockchain contract execution. Today, there are many use cases that could benefit from recurring or scheduled jobs that are triggered to execute in a trustless manner.
With Near Cron, we aim to allow any contract to be able to schedule some logic to get executed in the future, once or many times, triggered by an approved party or directly via protocol, in an economically stable format.
