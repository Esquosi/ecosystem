Buying cryptocurrencies isnâ€™t easy and we think it should be. MoonPay makes the journey simpler, faster and safer for everyone.

MoonPay is the new standard for fiat to crypto. We are a marketplace between cryptocurrency exchanges and users facilitating instant non-custodial purchases of major cryptocurrencies. Our mission is to make crypto accessible to everyone. Founded in 2018, MoonPay is working with leading crypto companies to solve the fiat-to-crypto onramp challenge. We offer best-in-class developer tools, including a customizable widget and public APIs, to enable crypto companies to build seamless purchase experiences. MoonPay currently services customers in Europe and UK and plans to expand globally in 2019.
