“The NEAR Legal Guild has been formed to provide legal expertise and support to NEAR projects, DAOs, and entrepreneurs, at a time when different regulations on crypto and blockchain can be problematic for industry enthusiasts. From research and direction, to working with specific projects, to outlining boundaries for DAOs and the issuance of tokens, the NEAR Legal Guild is setting up shop to provide a first-of-its kind ecosystem vehicle about the legal challenges emerging in this new and innovative space.”
