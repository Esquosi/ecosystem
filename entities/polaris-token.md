Polaris (Ticker: $PLRS) is an utility token on the Aurora Chain, our main objective is to bring security, functionality, and easement of use to the average investor in the network.

By bringing the first liquidity locker to the environment we are trying to ensure that every new investor in the chain can be protected from potentially malicious developers and that token owners can reassure their buyers about the safety of their funds.
We also care about our own investors, with an LP farming pool in the works to incentivize improving the health of our liquidity pool and to allow for bigger purchases, with a $PLRS-themed NFT project coming soon after to further develop our community while looking forward to creating even more utilities for the Aurora Chain.
